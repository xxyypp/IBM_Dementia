The 3d design is divided into two parts. The first part is to design the box to contain paige. The box is 10.7cm long, 6.2cm 
wide and 5.1cm high. On the long side of box, there is a gap to fit the bulge part of paige. The pirmary idea of this design is
to make the size of box as small as possible. There is a 2cm x 1.9cm gap near the center of bottom to allow the sensor work 
properly. There are 4 3.03cm x 0.16cm small gaps around the center and velcro tape to fasten paige on arm. The second part is 
to design the screen case to cover the wire and wiring board. The screen size is 7.8cm long and 5.4cm wide. The tickness of the
box and screen case is 0.1cm in order to minimize the weight of design and make it stable.
